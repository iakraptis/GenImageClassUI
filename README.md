# GenImageClassUI
A simple GUI for a fake photo detector project. The model has been trained on images generated through the use of Stable Diffusion 1.5, Stable Diffusion 3.5 and Sana 1.5.

This project is a simple GUI using Gradio that loads the already trained model, and provides a User Interface where an end user can use their own photos and check if they are real or generated through the use of AI.

## Model
